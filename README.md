# Tidyverse
An introduction to the tidyverse

This is a workshop that was provided on 23rd May 2019 by Kate Dodds to the MQ R Users group.
Most of the material is based on the wonderfully put together online presentation by R Ladies Sydney found here:

The RMD (R markdown) doc is now saved as Version 2 - this actually knits corectly! 

Enjoy!
